system support require streamlined staff login method example staff member swipe card log terminal staff member log terminal using hisher individual login password
system administrator create reliable report template available staff run modified staff person particular need change template could done without comprising result administrator limit filter display field altered certify dependable output example frontline staff could set call number range weeding report add remove designated display field pick list ’ alter template display deleted item
system provides distinct finegrained permission level limiting create clone report permission easy administer system administrator create shared folder allow disallow staff run specific report andor run ad hoc report specific set data
system provides userfriendly interface designing query record type staff select field query select value picklist possible value select regular expression dropdown menu use full range boolean operator administrator control staff access table field
system provides predefined report consumption library board consumer report providing basic statistic like required georgia annual report application state aid activity report indicate traffic volume use display statistic checkout checkins hold placed hold filled possible crosstabulated per terminal per branch per library system per hour per patron age range per patron type per patron location
transaction archived form protects patron privacy defined state law providing useful demographic statistic
example periodic report bibliographic record hold item checked x day itemlevel hold item invalid item type intransit item outstanding hold item intransit x day item last copy thesystem item long call number missing item bibliographic record item record patron invalid home library
system provides query selection along result
ability see report queue report waiting run
system must able support reporting definition described appendix
system must able support finegrained report requirement described appendix b
system produce statistic used understand predict patron behavior use material example quickly particular book returned average likely particular book renewed percent checkout particular branch renewal
ability report volume material given library point time based new acquisition item shelf item circulation ability break volume category eg total item library number hold number adult fiction number board book etc
system provides interface showing capacity branch defined pine
genre format material ability compare percentage total circulation percentage collection percentage total shelf space genreformat comprises ability report per library per system
ability control inventory uncataloged material paperback book childrens board book support quick distribution minimal branch labor ability identify material used ability count transaction include circulation statistic report
system provides utility transferring batch item branch used example move book mobile library outreach program collection justintime warehouse utility includes ability query candidate material ability save query repeated use ability manually select title query result ability change record selected item move new location mechanism moving item include changing location field generating pull list etc addition utility provides mean revert item original location set period time andor based criterion
system generates list item intransit x day x configurable per branch per system report would merge transit transit one report ease frontline staff use
system provides utility report identifying item record purge based customizable criterion item status missing x month item status discardweed system report assist conversion item one status another system provides last copy report would single library system last copy assist cataloger need edit worldcat entry system provides quick effective method deleting volume entry along copy entry well record item attached
ability count track record deletion eg item record patron record per location per system
query report limited grouped various patron characteristic including age range zip code county residence home branch patron type preferred language
system generates list patron circulation electronic activity last x day x configurable list configurable system home library county etc
transaction history maintained x day x configurable monthly annual aggregate information maintained indefinitely
transaction grouped hour terminal branch system transaction include checkins checkout fine collected patron registration etc queried transaction type transaction
system count type checkin individually cumulatively bookdrop terminal user selfservice
system count type checkout individually cumulatively staff checkout self checkout staff renewal self checkout renewal online renewal opac renewal
system count hold request including hold placed staff desk public computer inside library remotely
system generate report transaction hold placed hold filled checkout per patron per library per selected group library per system per county system display number checkout placed hold per patron hold subtotaled type eg active frozen frozenuntil hold
system generate report value item based data item record entire collection portion example staff obtain value item status longoverdue value dvd childrens collection value entire collection
report data archiving must comply standard accounting practice state county municipal auditing requirement
fine charge waiver ecommerce transaction attached patron item record system track fine waived payment made per library financial information updated easily example staff user easily query patron account balance greater x dollar
system provides financial report including patron account balance patron home library system fine charge accrued per time period eg last twelve month ytd last month per type charge overdue fine damaged item charge lost item charge etc fine waived per time period per branch payment made per time period per payment method eg staff desk selfcheck station opac
system maintains ledger patron payment including charge payment applied facilitate reconciliation
software design phase mockup built show function operation product later executable product primary function implemented
assumed every team member basic knowledge programming software engineering database
subphase team leader person deliver work schedule weekly goal beginning subphase
used existing template structure document added meeting minute project deliverable reference team member
fixed formatting table content added template reference
diagram designer charge designing diagram project documentation includes uml diagram prototype process diagram management plan kaos diagram documenting requirement graphical form
way avoid scope creep develop change control procedure good design specification start good communication develop good software development process avoiding agile software development
careful “ scope creep ” uncontrolled change large project fall victim scope creep scope creep often result cost overrun
major technology rely upon could possibly fail major technology risk thing like google phone android software andor algorithm etc
